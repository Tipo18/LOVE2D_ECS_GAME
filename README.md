# LOVE2D_ECS_GAME

It's one of my first game developped
I tested few game dev engine : Bevy based on rust and pygame. I wasn't realy taken on I founded that it was not intuitive to use and quite laborious,
I think if you really learn them you can take advantage of the build-in tools and libs but my end goal was more about learning than having the best finished and complex game.

Therefore I choosed to try LÃ–VE2D based on lua : a fairly simple game engine with this quite transparent language.
And i would say I'm convinved, it's really to start and having working stuff and driving the rest of the developpement process is thefore manageable
but even with this lowkey and simple approach you're able to have complex and interesting result.
I had a blast tweaking shaders (i took inspiration from Balatro and ressources from Balatro to try to create this satisfactory felling)

My game is called Rest Room and the objectif is to get unlost and find the rest room
it's a simple platformer where quite everything was made from scratch.
It may be not much visible but i founded the 2d pixel based design quite cool and i worked a bit upon that, I would I've like to have a bit more time
exploring this, possibilties techniques and just making assets
for the stories I thought about transition with opening and clossing lift doors and scenes where you choose a floor between level
and also i wanted to make a level generator build on the level plateform and wall that i created

The ECS way of developping seems cool, it's a smart way to develop game i think

My few bad return on this project was getting stuck in some places because of clock and trying to get instances destroyed but next time i'll be able to tackle them out more quicklky

ty for reading and see ya
